Hi, welcome to my portfolio!
This is where I showase my Data Analysis skills and projects. I specialise in Excel, Tableau and Python with Data Visualisation being my strong suit. To further my skills, I am currently learning SQL on Coursera.

In my free time, I assist university and polytechinc students with their Data Analysis projects, helping to achieve distinctions. 
My creativity and attention to detail allows me to efficiently visualise huge volumes of data, making it easier to achieve business goals.
