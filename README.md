Hi, welcome to my portfolio!
This is where I showase my Data Analysis skills and projects. I specialise in Excel, Tableau and Python with Data Visualisation being my strong suit. To further my skills, I am currently working on a self-taught SQL project. In my free time, I assist university and polytechinc students with their Data Analysis projects, helping to achieve distinctions. 

My creativity and attention to detail allows me to efficiently visualise huge volumes of data, making it easier to achieve business goals. I am extremely independant, and results-driven. Being a team leader for group projects has exposed me to different group dynamics and working styles, improving my communication and teamwork skills.

I am always looking to learn and improve, seeking opportunities that will develop and deepen my Data Analysis skills.

Feel free to chat with me about my projects!
